possibilities:
-QM as detachment/reattachment (Wetzels)
-QM as maintaining quantity after shortening (Ultan)
	-vs shortening as subset of QM (Wetzels)
	-Miller 1982??
-QM as actual metathesis of [+length] feature
-QM as compensatory lengthening??

analyses of metathesis:
-with compensatory lengthening (Hume)
	-deletion or transposition of vowel does not affect underlying mora
-copy/delete (Blevins & Garrett)
-deletion/reattachment (Besnier)

------------------------------------------------------------

compare
	-Blevins Garrett epenthesis --> deletion pseudo-metathesis 
	-Besnier deletion --> reattachment actual metathesis

compensatory metathesis

QM as type of CL

autoseg metathesis needs 4 spreading/delinking operations Butskh...

mora stuff Hume

Besnier
Probert

shortening: Miller (green book), Wetzels

ultan 1978 - syllabic met, QM as maintaining quantity after shortening
